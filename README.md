# whatsapp-web-multi-device-reveng

In this repository, the research for reverse engineering multi-device WhatsApp Web takes place, see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/download-and-installation/about-multi-device-beta/?lang=en) for a description of this feature.

For faster communication, this repository is completed by a respective [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ED6NCzhaCE).

To execute the current demo code, just run the following (note that a file `qr.png` will be created in the root directory):

```
python3 main.py
```

## Research Contents

- [Inspecting the Web App](/inspect-app.md): Pushing arbritary code into the WhatsApp Electron web app.

Apart from that, look through the Markdown files in the `pocs` subdirectory for more.
